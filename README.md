# Social Pulse: Sentiments on Social Media Platforms




## Description
The Social Media Sentiment Analysis Project is a web-based tool designed to analyze the sentiment of social media posts provided by users. Its main purpose is to help users understand the emotional tone of a given post by categorizing it as positive (1), negative (-1), or neutral (0). By analyzing the sentiments expressed in social media content, individuals and organizations can gauge the overall sentiment trends, identify potential issues, and take appropriate actions to maintain or enhance their online presence. The project processes the input link, extracts the text content, performs sentiment analysis, and presents the results through intuitive visualizations such as pie charts. Users can gain valuable insights into the sentiment of social media content, making it a valuable tool for understanding public opinion and trends on various platforms.
## Usage
