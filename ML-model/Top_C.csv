"A group of honeybees looking for a new home. Somewhere in there is the queen - the scouts are looking for a new hive, while this big clump protects the queen"
"This is how honeybee colonies (called ‚Äúsuper organisms‚Äù) reproduce! When the hive becomes too full, they‚Äôll create a new queen. Once that queen has emerged and mated, the old queen will fly off with roughly half the worker bees. It‚Äôs called a swarm and is totally natural!! They‚Äôre super docile as they don‚Äôt have anything to protect anymore and they‚Äôll probably go away soon (unless you have a hollow tree nearby‚Äî that‚Äôs their favorite place to nest) I‚Äôd definitely watch and see where they go because sometimes they end up building inside of your house. Takes the whole ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in your walls‚Äù joke a little TOO seriously"
They are just having a family meeting about the cheapest place to live at.
Call the local bee keeper. They'd luv to get their hands on these.
Located in southern CA
"Oh ya know, they‚Äôre just hangin‚Äô out"
"Your avocado tree now has a guardian honey bee swarm, a tired queen and workers chose your tree as their hive location after a nuptial flight which is when a new queen leaves an established hive to create her own colony.

 You're a lucky person, you can keep them and foster them over the years or you can find a local beekeeper who will come to your location and take the swarm and incorporate them into their own swarm."
[it's a swarm!](https://youtube.com/shorts/dE6U4NgdEtw?si=c5_eh3UD1_z1Y2AS)
Call a beekeeper or reach out to anyone who may know a keeper. They will happily take the bees away and give them a new home.
This happened twice on jobs we were working on. We called a beekeeper. They came and got the queen put it in a little box in a hive and all the bees went in
You could have a chance of getting a new beehive in your yard!
Gotta call the ASMR bee lady to rehome them
"If you look close you can see the scouts come back and shake back and forth to tell others about potential spots to build a new hive. They point their tail towards the spot and shake back and forth. The more vigorous the shaking the better the spot and the length of each shake tells distance. 

Eventually others will go check it out and if they agree will come back and help tell others about the spot until every single be has been touched. Then they all move to the new hive and start spreading pheromones to announce their new home."
They after freshavocado
Honestly I really love your avocado tree
"They huddled over the queen. 

There is a queen in that big clump. 

If they shuddering it‚Äôs a warning to keep back. 

Call a beekeeper and see if they will come and take them."
Find a beekeeper near where you live.  Contact one of them. They'll remove and relocate them for free normally.  They don't have a hive any longer so are taking refuge on your tree.  They shouldn't charge anything if they are true beekeepers.
Hive swarm happens when there is too many bees and enough resources/space in the hive
"I‚Äôve had this happen in SoCal too but when I called the bee keepers they want $200+
I checked on Yelp and they all charged, I thought would be somewhat free from all the honey but I guess they got to make money somehow"
"Also called ""shimmering."" They use it to ward off predators.

"Check my past posts, this happened to me in Phoenix and I got some good advice. I basically left the swarm alone for 6 days and they disappeared. Top comment here is spot on! If they don‚Äôt go away just find a local bee keeper as others suggested. They are so cool"
It is a compliment to your garden that the bees chose to stop by!
Whatever you do don't kill them bees are extremely important
"They probably moving nests they swarm like that to protect the queen while worker bees try find a new nesting spot. 
Fun fact if one bee thinks it‚Äôs found a good spot it goes back and has the job of convincing the colony"
Call a bee charmer someone‚Äôs bees have swarmed. They need someone to help them it‚Äôs too late in the season they probably won‚Äôt make it through winter without help
You can call a local Bee Keeper and they'll professionally remove the hive for you without anyone getting stung
"Millennial Bees and their avocado toast, ruining honey making industry with their BS about needing to ""protect a queen"" and that they ""can't afford real estate so need to find a new home""...pssh get a real job and pull yourself up by your bootstraps üòâ"
I think that‚Äôs just a fuzzy avocado. Let it ripen naturally
This is so cool and I'm jealous you got to witness this!!
Lucky you! It‚Äôs a swarm looking for a new home! Get a hive set up and they‚Äôll help pollinate plants within a 5 mile radius!
"Queen absconded from the nest, minions followed."
There's a pretty cool episode of this on Our Planet 2
You have an adorable swarm.
"A new queen has emerged, and the bees are swarming around her in order to form a new colony."
Call a beekeeper so they can give them a good home or just leave them alone for a few days as they usually move on. We had one in a bush and they came and went without any problems.  They are just looking for a new home.  Beekeepers can provide one if you have any in your area.
That‚Äôs so cool!
"It's a swarm- basically they're in the process of creating a new hive.  You could call a beekeeper to catch them, or just let them move on.  They won't stay longer than a day or two."
Free bees buddy. Grab a hive and put the queen in there.
Just a swarm. Queen is in there
"There should be a local bee keeper or bee keeping society/club you can call, that can give you advice.  And usually send someone to come pick them up, and give them a safe home."
"Woah! I know you got an answer to this already, but if you have some local beekeepers, give them a call! I'm sure they'd love to take them! My dad is a beekeeper and often retrieves swarms too, it's a whole buncha fun!"
They are swarming! Grab a box and get yourself a beehive!
It's a swarm. They recently left their old hive
"They're just passing through, looking for a new home. Nothing to worry about, they'll be gone soon."
Saw your question has some good answers so I won't give advice.  Just wanted to say good on you for being concerned about the bees and asking.
It‚Äôs a swarm. The old queen is looking for a new home. They should leave on their own after a little bit üòä
You have been blessed by a new hive!
"If you can leave that there, it will be better for the environment."
I'd leave them if they nest in your backyard they will make a good pollinator for you. Unless your scared of bees.
"Bees tend to tremble after they have watched ""the notebook"" just tell them that you are there if they need to talk and retreat to a safe distance"
Hit it with a stick
The title of this post is poetry
"The good news is that swarming honeybees don‚Äôt sting much.  I don‚Äôt know why not.

The bad news is that after they set up a hive, they will definitely defend it by stinging. The space behind the siding on your house or up in your attic are both great places to set up a hive.

Is that Leucadia?  I‚Äôve seen a lot of avocado trees like that in Leucadia backyards."
"Google your county and ‚Äúapiary‚Äù

Call and they will come happily. This is a free hive"
I did not know avocados grew on trees
That‚Äôs a honeybee swarm. They‚Äôll stay as little as an hour up to days. Depends how long it takes them to find a home. They are generally docile when they‚Äôre swarmed like this. Contacting a local beekeeper will result in them being removed free of charge. Otherwise they will likely leave on their own.
Leave them bee
Migrating. Looking for a new place to call home. They‚Äôll move soon.
You might consider checking to see if you can find a local bee keeper. We had a swarm at my place of employment back in the mid 90s. I called a local bee keeper and he came and placed them in a new hive. I got to help and it was pretty cool.
"Had 3 swarms from our hive earlier this year. First one hung around 5 days before they moved on. 2nd and 3rd swarms left after 3 days. They‚Äôre just passing through, hopefully."
They're on the move to a new hive. They're not aggressive and should be left alone
Queenie needs a home looks like.
you‚Äôve been chosen
I was sunning in my backyard once when a huge swarm of honey bees filled the sky over me.  It was loud and intimidating.  They collected in tree and hung out for a half hour or so.  It had to be at least two cubic feet of bees.  I stayed inside the rest of the day.
"Waooo, so natural"
Call a bee keeper!
"They‚Äôre swarming. Id recommend calling a beekeeper to ensure they find a nice, safe home."
This happened to a tree near my workplace and the bees were gone the next day
"Be aware that most feral colonies of honey bees in southern California are considered Africanized. Generally, they cannot be ‚Äòkept‚Äô like the European counterparts and must be destroyed. There is really no way to tell if these are a European swarm or an Africanized swarm. Bees are calmer during swarming because they are looking for a place, not defending one. Don‚Äôt be deceived if they are behaving calmly. It is best you hire a professional to remove them. Reed Booth, aka the Killer Bee Guy has a youtube channel and he deals with Africanized Bee removal daily. They are mean as hell and very dangerous. Don‚Äôt take a chance. Keep your distance and get professional help."
Oooh I'm so jealous I'm trying to catch a swarm or two.
They‚Äôre protecting their Queen. Maybe? ü§®
I bee-lieve this is called festooning (forgive my spelling I've only ever heard the word). The bees are looking for a place to call home.
Queen stopped for a rest she will move on soon and they will follow her.
"Call a bee keeper, they know what to do to remove them from your tree."
They‚Äôre swarming just looking for a new home
"A swarm! You can call local beekeepers, and they‚Äôll come get them."
